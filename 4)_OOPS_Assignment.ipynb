        "**Ans-1)** 5 key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming are as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.   **Class and Object:-** A class acts as a blueprint for creating objects, defining the attributes (data) and methods (functions) that objects of that class will have. An object is an instance of a class, meaning a specific realization of the class with its own data values.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.   **Encapsulation:-** It actualy works as access modifier, means it is used to decide which part of codes are to be restricted from the access of outsider and which code are to be accessed but only by the known the known and and whch codes are to be public i.e accessible for everyone to reach and edit as per their own need(s). There are 3 types of encapsulation or access modifiers-\n",
        "*  Public access modifier\n",
        "*  Protected modifier\n",
        "*  Private modifier\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Polymorphism:-** Polymorphism allows a single interface to represent different data types or objects. For example, the same method or operator can perform different operations in different scenarios.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Data Abstraction:-** Data abstraction hides complex implementation details and provides a simplified interface. It only provides essential information about the data to the outside world.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Inheritence:-** Inheritance allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class. This promotes code reuse. There are multiple types of inheritance mentioned below:-\n",
        "*   Single level inheritance\n",
        "*   Multilevel Inheritance\n",
        "*   Multiple Inheritance\n",
        "*   Hierarchial Inheritance\n",
        "*   Hybrid Inheritance\n",

        "**Ans-6)** 5 types of inheritence in Python are as follows:\n",
        "1.   **Single inheritance-** It refers to the process of child receiving its properties from single parent. It have only two classes-one is base class and the another one is derived class. Derived class can have its own properties also as well as its parent class's properties too but parent class will only have its own properties and not of its child class.\n",
        "2.   **Multilevel Inheritance-** It refers to the process of child receiving its properties in same vertically derived class. Like a child receiving its properties only from his/her father's side family members including his own properties his father and grandfather's properties but not from his/her other side family member's properties.\n",
        "3.   **Multiple Inheritance-** It refers to the process of child receiving their properties from more than one parent class. It is also termed as Diamond problem because here always arises a question that of which parent class will it fetch its properties from and on what basis in result to which its answer comes that the parent class which is inherited first in the dervied class that parent class properties will be get added to it.\n",
        "4.   **Hierarchial Inheritance-** It refers to process in which dervied class are more than one but parent class or base class is only one. Like vehicle is the parent class and every model cars and trucks or any other automobile all belongs to the base class vehicle.\n",
        "5.   **Hybrid Inheritance-** It is a combination of multiple inheritance and hierarchial inheritance.\n",
